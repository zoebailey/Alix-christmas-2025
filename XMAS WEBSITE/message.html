            I made this website for you and hope that you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it for you.
            You are the best person I could ask to share my life with, and continue life with me.
            I love you so much and you deserve the world. I know that Christmas is a special time for you,
            and so I just wanted to make something special for you. I hope you feel so loved, noticed,
            considered, appreciated, and cared for not just with this project but every single day. You
            help me grow every single day and make me a better person. A better person for myself, for
            you, for my friends, and for my family. I have seen so much growth in myself this past
            year and I know that a lot of it is because of you. I am so privileged to love you,
            and watch you grow as well in your own ways. Your mental health has improved so much
            and I see all of the ways in which you really are trying to improve in every aspect of your
            life. I am so so so proud of you. I love you so much and I love being loved by you.<br><br>
        
            Love,<br>
            Zoe<br>
